   ```

2. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Frontend bundle is 863KB (could be code-split)
   - Add loading states for better UX
   - Implement pagination for large opportunity lists

3. **Enhanced Features** (future development):
   - User authentication system
   - Opportunity bookmarking/favorites
   - Email notifications for new opportunities
